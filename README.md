# raspberry_pi_shortcuts
These are some helpful Python programs for starting out with a Raspberry Pi.

## LED
To run it use run `python3 led_test.py <GPIO_NUM> <DURATION> <NUM_REPEATS> <DELAY>` in the Terminal
only the first two inputs are Necessary.

## Distance Sensor
`python3 distance_sensor.py <COMMAND> <GPIO_NUM>`
The Distance Sensor will be given more Commands soon, but currently you can only use 'calc_dist'.
